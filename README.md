# BankDataAnalysis: Introduction
This project involves working on a dataset of a Bank intented to know details of its risk analytics and to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to its customers. This is the problem statement.
# Soltution
To create a dashboard using Power BI to help the organisation to make a decision based on the client's profile i.e. if the applicant is likely to repay the loan or not. 
# Dataset
The data is of 3000 customers. It has the following columns: Client ID', 'Name', 'Age', 'Location ID', 'Joined Bank','Banking Contact', 'Nationality', 'Occupation', 'Fee Structure','Loyalty Classification', 'Estimated Income', 'Superannuation Savings', 'Amount of Credit Cards', 'Credit Card Balance', 'Bank Loans', 'Bank Deposits', 'Checking Accounts', 'Saving Accounts', 'Foreign Currency Account', 'Business Lending', 'Properties Owned', 'Risk Weighting', 'BRId', 'GenderId', 'IAId', 'Income Band', 'Total Loan'
BRId is Banking Relationship, IAId is Investment Advisor and GenderID is Gender. The dataset was initially divided into 4 sheets, for the sake of simplicity it is combined into one. The dataset is sourced from Keggle. 
** In the dashboard, the name and logo of Deutsche Bank is used, it is solely used to make it appealing, the respective bodies have copyrights. The used dataset is only a sample and does not reveal true names and/or identity.

Alternatively, visualisation can also be achieved by directly loading the excel into Power BI and performing transformation as required.
